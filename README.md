Code Review 2
=====================================

A Scala Play application that allows developers to perform code reviews over Subversion based repositories.

The reasons for building this application are:

* I wanted to learn how to use the Play framework by building an application that was useful,
* I wanted to start playing with interactive HTML pages, and
* I chose code reviews because it is something that I need and I have been unable to find anything that was free and fitted into my workflow

Ultimately I wanted to play with new concepts and educate myself through doing rather than only through reading.
